5,"Around 94 million tons of fiber were processed around the world in 2020, for example for clothing, technical textiles or home textiles. Fiber consumption is growing with the world population and disposable income, on average between two and three percent per year.  The process from fiber to textile begins with fiber production. A yarn is produced from the fibers, for example from cotton, linen, polyester or viscose. A textile is then produced from the yarn via various processing steps such as weaving, knitting, dyeing or finishing.  Yarn is produced in two basically different ways. On the one hand, this is done by spinning staple fibers. ",105,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_
5,"These are fibers with a staple length of 23 to 60 mm short-staple fibers or over 60 mm long-staple fibers. On the other hand, yarn is produced by processing so-called filaments to make continuous filament yarn. The yarns resulting from filaments have different properties than those produced from staple fibers. In the clothing industry, the yarn produced from staple fiber predominates because it offers pleasant wearing comfort.  Each of the two types of yarn production accounts for around 50 of world fiber consumption.  Rieter is mainly engaged in yarn production from staple fibers. The most important of these in 2020 are cotton about 22 million tons, polyester about 17 million tons and viscose about 5 million tons.  ",117,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_
5,"The process for producing a yarn from staple fibers consists of three stages: fiber preparation, spinning preparation and end spinning.  In fiber preparation, the fibers, which are delivered in bales, are separated, cleaned if necessary, and aligned. This takes place in the process stages blowroom/opener and card. Spinning preparation involves the homogenization and drawing of the sliver. The machine required for this is known as the draw frame. In cotton processing, the comber also plays a role: here, short fibers are combed out in order to produce a higher quality yarn. By the end of the spinning preparation stage, a uniform sliver or roving has been produced.  ",107,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_
5,"Twisting takes place either by means of a rotating spindle ring spinning, compact spinning, by rotation of a rotor rotor spinning or by an air flow air-jet spinning. Compact spinning is a variant of ring spinning that uses an  auxiliary device to achieve yarn with a higher density as a result of improved fiber integration.  After spinning, imperfections are removed from the yarn. The yarn is then wound on a package, in order to present it in a suitable form for the subsequent process steps in the textile production chain.  With its spinning systems Rieter covers all four end spinning processes established on the market.",105,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_
6,"The production capacity of a ring spindle serves as the basis. The spinning unit of a rotor spinning machine corresponds to the productivity of five to six ring spindles, whereas that of an air-jet spinning machine corresponds to the productivity of 20 ring spindles.  A total of more than 250 million spindle equivalents worldwide were used in 2020 to produce yarn from the around 50 million tons of staple fibers, of which around 100 million are in China, 55 million in India, 70 million in the Asian countries excluding China, India and Turkey and 12 million in Turkey. Every year, between 11 and 13 million spindle equivalents are installed on average, with 6.5 million delivered or installed in 2020. ",119,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_
6,"Rieter delivered 850 000 spindle equivalents 2019: 1.32 million in 2020. In addition, spinning mills require wear and spare parts for ongoing operation.  Rieter is the market leader with a market share of around 30.  The business with new machines is cyclical. The tendency to invest in the spinning industry is mainly influenced by expectations regarding fiber consumption and the margins that can be achieved by selling yarns. Fiber consumption is dependent on the economy, while the margins for yarn depend on the movement of raw material prices, capacity utilization and the production costs of the spinning mills, foreign exchange rates and government policies.  Global volume for staple fiber machines per year",112,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_
7,"The business with wear and spare parts is much less cyclical. The basic business is driven by the degree of capacity utilization of spinning mills – operational spinning mills require wear and spare parts. Project business such as the conversion or modernization of entire spinning mills, on the other hand, are subject to the investment cycle described above.  Product and service offering Rieter plans spinning mills, develops, produces and supplies the machines for fiber preparation, spinning preparation and end spinning, and supervises the installed machines throughout their life cycle.

The importance of energy efficiency for yarn production and Rieter’s contribution is illustrated by the following simplified example: A ring spinning machine of the latest generation with 2 000 spindles achieves energy savings of 10 compared to an older machine and thus reduces energy consumption by 80 MWh per year. Over the use of 1 million spindles through 500 Rieter machines with 2 000 spindles each, energy consumption is reduced by 40 000 MWh per year.  ",97,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_

In the spinning process, each production step has a different energy requirement, with end spinning consuming the most energy, followed by carding. For decades, development teams at Rieter have paid particular attention to the lowest possible energy consumption in each individual spinning process and incorporated this into the design of the machines. The aim is to reduce energy consumption for every kilogram of yarn produced. ",106,GBR_HS22_CSR_RIETER N,RIETER N,_CSR_
